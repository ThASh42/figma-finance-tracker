# figma-finance-tracker

This is a windowed program made using Figma and Python, designed to calculate your balance by recording and tracking your expenses.

## Why it was made?
This project is designed for learning the basics of Figma and UX/UI concepts, with Python used to implement the logic behind the application. It serves as the final project for the discipline "Designing UX and UI components of information systems" at the Kyiv National Economic University named after Vadym Hetman, during my second year of study. The goal is to combine design and functionality to create a simple financial tracking tool.
